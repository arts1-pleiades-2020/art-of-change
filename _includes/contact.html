A growth in arts employment, for example, has a positive and causal effect on overall national employment. The arts also provide economic diversification and are proven to recover more rapidly from economic downturns without being anchored down by other slower recovering sectors. Essentially, they are small investments that deliver big returns; by creating jobs, generating tax revenues, and stimulating local economies through tourism and consumer purchases, the arts can build social cohesion and strengthen our national economy.</p>
