                        <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted"><p class="paragraph">Various art forms have been present throughout our colorful history, with evidence stating its first known existence in the country to be predating the pre-colonial period such as the various ornaments found in Cagayan, Palawan, and Sorsogon (Tanedo, W.D., 2016). Over the years, various changes have occured within the discipline: ranging from the introduction of fine arts, sculpture, and architecture by the Spanish colonization; the adaptation of commercialized artistry during the American colonial period; and the transition to contemporary arts during the post-colonial period. To summarize, it has been ingrained within our culture and thereby representative of our history. </p> </h3>
                        <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted"><p class="paragraph">Time and time again, the Philippines has become a hotspot for both local and international art communities that have been able to produce a steady stream of talented artists. Essentially, this artistry has reached levels deemed equal to their foreign counterparts in the context of global competitiveness. However, there is no denying the fact that the arts are still undervalued and neglected in our country. </p> </h3>
                        <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted"><p class="paragraph">No proper system has been established that would encourage and motivate artists in the pursuit of their passions. The creative sector is severely underfunded given the government’s prioritization of other economic sectors. Local, lesser-known artists, in particular, struggle as their value and worth are constantly jeopardized, imposed by the dominant social institutions in place. Various companies and institutions exploit these artists for exposure rather than providing financial support as their basis for motivation. To add, most of these artists languish in negligence and indifference unless they have already established themselves within the art world. All of these factors contribute to the migration of artists to other countries, the redirection of creative services, and the lack of the establishment of local institutions related to the arts as if seemingly in some sort of a feedback loop. </p> </h3>
                        <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted"><p class="paragraph">With the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, many industries were negatively affected during its wake, including those that make up the bulk of the economy such as manufacturing and agriculture. Many businesses were shut down in response to the quarantine protocols set in place by the government, thereby affecting the livelihood of many. This causation would result in the worst recession that the Philippines has ever experienced (De Vera, 2021), warranting a policy reform that could hopefully lead to the nation’s widespread economic recovery. The ongoing pandemic has challenged art as we view it, but the creative sector has found remarkable ways to show their art and reach their audience confined at home. Many museums, galleries, and other creative establishments have transitioned to digital platforms (Sorilla, 2020).</p> </h3>
                        <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted"><p class="paragraph">In this regard, we submit that the arts are an untapped resource. The creative industries offer numerous benefits to local and national economies, and we have the opportunity to improve livability and boost our economies by investing in the arts and culture. By encouraging investments in creative startups and online businesses by granting loans and seed capital, financing equipment and tools, and providing tax incentives and other subsidies, the arts can significantly contribute to community development and the nation’s overall economic growth. </p> </h3>
                        <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted"><p class="paragraph">The arts and culture have only been recently recognized as a viable economic asset not only by the Philippines but also other nations. The world’s economy is shifting from one based on the manufacturing and heavy industries to a creative one whose goods are mainly based on intellectual property. The utilization of these industries, however, cannot be achieved unless a stable foundation or legislation is built upon which it will operate. Hence, we advocate the establishment of the Creative Industries Act of 2021. This bill, in essence, will help us understand and measure our creative industries, develop strategies that will allow us to capitalize on the benefits that these industries have to offer, and provide support that helps sustain the contribution of the arts and culture sector. </p> </h3>

                        <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
                        <p class="paragraph">The Department of Trade and Industry’s goal of becoming the leading creative economy in the ASEAN by 2030 seems to be absurd without legislation or a legitimized government support that will promote the development of creative industries. Hence, Paolo Mercado, along with Rep. De Venecia and the other instigators, proposed a bill that consolidates previous bills supporting creative industries not only to rationalize the need for government support but more importantly, to delineate our potential of becoming globally competitive in terms of arts. This bill is known as the Philippine Creative Industries Act of 2021. 
                            <br><br>The Philippine Creative Industries Act, in essence, seeks to promote creative industries as a priority economic sector to generate high-value jobs, contribute to GDP growth, increase international exports of Filipino creative products and services, and develop our intellectual property capital. 
                            <br><br>The creative industries are among the fastest growing sectors in our economy. However, with the ongoing pandemic and the implementation of strict precautionary measures, many workers have been displaced, and the arts community suffered greatly as a consequence. This consolidated bill will not only help the affected workers in the creative industries to survive this crisis but also support and sustain this sector looking ahead on the road to national recovery.
                            <br><br>The key elements of the bill are as follows:
