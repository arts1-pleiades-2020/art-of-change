                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Cultural activities, creative industries and arts greatly contribute to a nation’s economic growth. It promotes and develop opportunities for jobs, collaboration, social cohesion and solidarity among our society. It unites people with different languages and race to understand the beauty of life with various forms of arts like music, film, painting and photography. This is why it’s important for us to have a deeper understanding of the economic contribution of arts and culture and to advocate policies, programs and effective strategies in making sure that we will be able to sustain the cultural sector and the creative industries especially in this most difficult time of Covid 19. 
Every country should initiate programs to promote arts and culture in helping the nation with it’s economic growth. We should all encourage these creative individuals to improve and continue to use their knowledge and skill in dealing and coping with the  pandemic. 
The Arts and Cultural sectors are considered as assets to the economy, they can also help and benefit other entrepreneurs with their collaboration in using their platform to promote businesses. 
In the Philippines we have a diverse and a huge number of innovative talents that can compete and has improved and developed to be recognized worldwide. We have different creative industries like the advertising, architecture, music, new media, performing arts, visual arts and literature which are already known with an reputation for a world class creativity. Examining the various policies for arts and cultural industries is needed to be act upon by the government to regulate, protect, and financially support these sectors. In recent years, there have been laws that were passed which support our culture like the Republic Act No. 7356 established by the National Commission for Culture and Arts. 
Due to the pandemic, many people lost their jobs, different sectors were greatly affected and one of them is the Arts and Creative Industries. There is a new law which is being developed by the House of Representatives to help and support our creative industries in providing funds for them headed by the  Pangasinan Representative Christopher de Venecia of the Special Committee on the Creative Industry and Performance Arts. The creative industries that the bill aims to support includes : individuals who produce artistic, cultural, goods, products, and services coming from their own skill and creativity. This proposed act will cover the following: 1. Audio and visual media, 2. Digital interactive media, 3. Creative Services, 4. Design , 5. Books, Publishing and Printed Media, 6. Performing Arts, 7. Visual Arts, 8. Traditional Cultural Expressions, 9. Cultural sites and 10. Other cultural domains and industries that the council may determine. As stated by Pablo Mercado, founder and president of the Creative Economy Council of the Philippines who is also an advocate of this initiative, “the bill aims to create a develop plan that will support the creative industries survive the pandemic, give incentives to the growing number of potential creative industries and promotes policies both local and national community level that will help raise our capabilities as a world class creative nation”. 
The proposed budget for this bill is 5 billion pesos which is still being discussed upon by the Committee. All members of the congress will have its second reading for approval. The latest version of this bill is dated April 16, 2021 and the goal is to have this bill passed before the next Presidential SONA which will be held in July 2021. 
Unquestionably, arts, culture and creative industries play an important role in our economy which we as a nation should recognize, support and appreciate the core values that they also create. They foster significant works and can help our nation prosper in the long run. They boost productivity, creativeness, growth and potential. They are essential for our future economy and should be promoted for their contribution. This is also a wake up call to urge our Nation to renew and strengthen our economic models and invest in policies that will help these sectors in their recovery and for their sustainable future.
