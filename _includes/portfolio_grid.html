                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
                        <p class="paragraph">Filipino artists can indeed be the catalyst for economic recovery. Throughout our history, all have witnessed how these artists have invaded the art scene worldwide and have brought not only glory to our country, but also helped our economy in one way or another. An example of this would be Lea Salonga, known for the different roles she portrayed on various Broadway musicals such as Les Misérables and Miss Saigon. Her most recent was Sweeney Todd musical, which also debuted in Singapore in 2019, after they performed in Manila (Nanda, 2019). And this time, Ms. Salonga was accompanied to Singapore by a cast of mostly Filipino artists. Exporting the talent of our local artists can be an additional source of income for our country.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">Alongside the theatre arts, we also have Filipinos thriving in the world of digital arts and animation. An article by the CIIT College of Arts and Technology entitled "Ten Successful Filipino Animators Who Made It Big in Hollywood" have enumerated various digital artists who have had significant contributions to the discipline of animation worldwide (2019). These artists include Nelson Bohol, who was part of Pixar's animation team and have contributed to the production of titles such as Inside Out, Monsters University, Brave, WALL-E, Ratatouille, Cars, and Finding Nemo.  Ruben Aquino is another individual whose work was featured in and worked on the films Winnie the Pooh, The Princess and the Frog, and Lilo and Stitch (Ten Successful Filipino Animators Who Made It Big in Hollywood, 2019).</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">The examples aforementioned are observed to be within the context of the international art scene, working under world-renowned studios and institutions. However, this does not mean that the local scene should be disregarded altogether; Rather, the scene and its artists should be viewed as capable as their international counterparts. Such an example of an artist gaining traction would be Nona Garcia, to which her works are exhibited under both local and foreign galleries. To add, Garcia was also recognized through her awards received, such as the 13 Artists Award and the Philip Morris Group of Companies ASEAN Art Award. Similarly, Ronald Ventura is another example to which his contemporary multimedia works rival its foreign counterparts. Much like Garcia, Ventura would then have his work exhibited both locally and globally, and is also awarded by various institutions worldwide.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">All of these examples would showcase the Filipino’s innate creativity, regardless of their background. The artists under both categories are capable of harnessing their artistry to levels appropriate for global competitiveness. However, their skill sets are much more utilized by institutions from other countries rather than locally, given the non-viability of art jobs within the Philippines. While this artistry still contributes to the national economy, the various institutions that host said artists are the ones that benefit the most with their works. This phenomenon may be attributed to the Philippine government’s perspective of the Arts as strictly cultural rather than seeing its economic potential; hence its redirection to other sectors such as tourism, entertainment, and sports.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">Such an example would be Monique Lhuillier and Micheal Cinco, familiar names as the two have already established themselves as world-renowned fashion designers. That said, their services are mostly commissioned by foreign clients, to which could have been beneficial to the nation's economic development. Locally, indigenous arts and crafts that originate from various regions may be exported in order to bolster the growth of our economy, with examples including the burnay from Ilocos, the various textile patterns weaved in Mindanao, the jewelry crafted in Central Luzon, and the metalcrafts from Mindanao to name a few. However, they are merely seen as artifacts used for cultural heritage. These are only a few examples wherein both culture and economy tie in with one another.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">The advent of the Creative Industries Act of 2021 would change all of this however, as the government starts to recognize the potential of the Arts not only in a cultural context but also an economical one. The establishment of this policy will establish Arts as a viable economic sector in itself and include the various domains relating to the creative industries. This would provide opportunities that would contribute directly to the national economy; timely for the country’s widespread economic recovery in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. With that said, the following are various projects/businesses/works by various artists that may categorized under the legislative act.</p>
